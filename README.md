# Discord Bot built using python

This is a discord bot project I worked on as one of my side projects. The bot is built using the Python programming language. I have worked on this bot for a few months and added features as time went on. To invoke the bot, the user must use '$' every time before a command. For example, $meme will return a meme from Reddit in the channel. The bot has three sub-divisions of commands. They are Economic, Fun, and Administrator. First, the user can play with the bot's own currency system in the Economic portion. They can check their balance, steal coins from other players, work in a job, etc. The ultimate goal of this economic game is to make the users compete with each other and be the wealthiest user on the server. Administrator commands are only invoked if the command user has specific administrative power in the server. They are used to delete messages in channels, kick a member from the server, etc. Last but not least, the Fun commands are just some commands the users can use. They include getting gifs, memes, quotes, profile pictures, etc.
